## Product Catalog

This is a comprehensive e-commerce application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to browse, search, and filter a product catalog, view product details, manage a shopping cart, and mark products as favorites. The app includes several pages for product categories such as phones, tablets, and accessories, and it implements advanced UI/UX features like smooth hover effects, dynamic image scaling, and responsive layouts. The application also utilizes local storage to persist user data for the cart and favorites across sessions.

## Technologies Used
React: Component-based architecture for building the UI

React Router: Navigation between different pages

TypeScript: Static typing for improved code quality and development experience

SCSS Modules: Modular and scoped styling

Context API or Redux: For state management of cart and favorites

UI/UX Features: Smooth scrolling, hover effects, pagination, and product sliders
